# Euler068 â€” Magic 5-gon ring

Arrange numbers 1..10 in a 5-gon ring so that each line (outer+two inner nodes) sums equally, and form the maximum 16-digit concatenated string starting from the minimal outer node.

## Approach

- Fix the minimal outer node to break rotational symmetry.
- Generate permutations for remaining positions with pruning: enforce equal line sums as soon as lines complete; ensure digit length=16 by placing 10 in an inner node only.
- Build the concatenated string in the mandated order and track the lexicographically largest 16-digit string.

## Edge Cases
- Rotational duplicates: Without fixing minimal outer as start, rotations produce duplicate solutions; enforce canonical start.
- Placement of 10: Must be outer to ensure 16 digits (otherwise concatenation shorter); enforce during generation.
- Line sum consistency: Partial assignments exceeding current best sum or inconsistent with partial target should prune early.
- Lex ordering: Comparing numeric strings of equal length is equivalent to lex compare; safe.
- State reuse: Avoid mutating arrays without backtracking restoration; copy or swap-back reliably.

## Complexity
- Pruned backtracking; fast.

## Practical examples and business impact
- Symmetry breaking in combinatorial generation to avoid duplicates.
  - Impact: Cuts search drastically with a single canonical choice.

## Key Takeaways
- Canonicalize start, enforce line sums early, and track max 16-digit concatenation.


## Java implementation (Euler068.java)

- Class: `Euler068`
- Generates permutations of 1..10; enforces that 10 is on the outer ring to ensure a 16-digit result and uses the smallest outer node as the start to break rotational symmetry.
- Checks each 5-gon line sum equals a common value; builds the concatenated string starting from the minimal outer node; tracks the best lexicographically.
- Output: The maximum 16-digit string.
