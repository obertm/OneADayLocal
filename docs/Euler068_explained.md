# Euler068 â€” Magic 5-gon ring

Arrange numbers 1..10 in a 5-gon ring so that each line (outer+two inner nodes) sums equally, and form the maximum 16-digit concatenated string starting from the minimal outer node.

## Strategy

- Fix the minimal outer node to break rotational symmetry.
- Generate permutations for remaining positions with pruning: enforce equal line sums as soon as lines complete; ensure digit length=16 by placing 10 in an inner node only.
- Build the concatenated string in the mandated order and track the lexicographically largest 16-digit string.

## Complexity
- Pruned backtracking; fast.

## Real-world analogues and impact
- Symmetry breaking in combinatorial generation to avoid duplicates.
  - Impact: Cuts search drastically with a single canonical choice.

## Takeaways
- Canonicalize start, enforce line sums early, and track max 16-digit concatenation.


## Java implementation (Euler068.java)

- Class: `Euler068`
- Generates permutations of 1..10; enforces that 10 is on the outer ring to ensure a 16-digit result and uses the smallest outer node as the start to break rotational symmetry.
- Checks each 5-gon line sum equals a common value; builds the concatenated string starting from the minimal outer node; tracks the best lexicographically.
- Output: The maximum 16-digit string.
