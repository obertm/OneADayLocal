# Euler042 â€” Coded triangle numbers

Count how many words in a list have a letter-sum that is a triangular number.

## Steps

- Word value: sum(ch - 'A' + 1) for letters.
- Precompute triangle numbers up to a safe max value and place in a HashSet.
- For each word, compute value and test membership.

## Complexity
- O(total characters) after O(T) precompute.

## Real-world analogues and impact
- Score-to-class membership checks.
  - Impact: Fast lookups using precomputed sets for ranges.

## Takeaways
- Precompute triangle set; linear scan over words; constant-time membership.
